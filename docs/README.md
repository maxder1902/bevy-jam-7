# Heaven sword Design document   
## Basic stuff   
Theme of the jam - Extremely Incohesive fever dream.   
Genre of the game - 1st person slasher with some puzzles and quests.   
Setting - High in the clouds (hence you're "high" like from smoking).   
   
# Main Character   
You play as agile girl ~25 yrs old, mainly calm personality, but the action of the game will test her mental stamina.   
Not much to know about her for now, but she probably has a dog in real life. The girl is fine, just really tired from her life. Somehow she falls asleep    
   
# Goal of the game   
Get to the end by clearing all the levels and wake up basically.   
   
# Game structure & world   
Set of individual levels each containing either action (fighting enemies), quests/puzzles, or a mix of both. Some suggested procedural generation between the levels, but I'm afraid it will take more time to implement properly, so I think we can just teleport between the levels using some objects at the end of each level. These objects could be unique for each level. You can also just drop down from one level to another (only one time in the game).   
The world as I picture it right now is basically a set of clouds in the sky with some structures injected into it e.g. very long crystals. Kind of like [Jack and the Beanstalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk) type of things. There will be some buildings and other objects levitating in the sky as well, kind of like in [Dishonored](https://youtu.be/VHG8vWZrKL0?si=MfCKWA-NxHhsr0e-&t=137) (mild spoilers). It's important to keep he world random, there's no point at which you can say "oh, I can definitely say where I am", it's always something undefined.
