# Puzzles   
Puzzles can be different, some of them may require you to parkour into specific location, some will be riddle type questions, and some will need you to find an object/several objects and use them in a special way.   
If we get creative I can think of something like "you can find an empty balloon and some stationary gas tank, you can fill the balloon and fly upwards"   
There also may be a puzzle of type "three dummies stand in front of you, you can hit them, and if you hit them in just the right order something will happen". This is a classic one, maybe we can do something to make it more interesting
