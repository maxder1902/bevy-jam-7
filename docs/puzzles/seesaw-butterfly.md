# Seesaw butterfly   
## Objects:    
trash-butterfly. trash is still and boring, butterfly flies around, doesn't stay still by itself unless there are flowers, it flies to them.   
flower-something.   
The level has a seesaw with one short side and a long side, each side has a platform to stand on or place objects.   
## Goal:   
The goal of the puzzle is to make it so the butterfly sits on the shorter side of the seesaw while you're standing on the long one. The butterfly will act as if it was super heavy, like 4 tonnes or something and it will catapult you to the next level.   
## Solution:    
That is going to be accomplished by first placing a flower onto small platform and attracting the butterfly.    
   
We can take it a bit further and make it so there are a lot of flowers in the level and what you have to do is to activate/deactivate the flowers to guide the butterfly. The level can be long-ish and the butterfly could be at the very beginning to force the player to backtrack.
